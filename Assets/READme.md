here is my wonderful portfolio, it may look like it was an effortless project, but I struggled all the way through it. I have learned a lot, and will continue to tweak this repository as my skills strengthen in coding.
A portfolio of me!! Welcome to my portfolio I designed, if you would like to see it view it here https://austinslatey.github.io/my-portfolio/ 
I wrote up a HTML file and styled it all using advanced css using properties like flex box so it becomes responsive to many screens no matter where you're viewing! A mobile device, tablet, monitor, or laptop!
